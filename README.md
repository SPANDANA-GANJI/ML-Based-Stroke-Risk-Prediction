# ML-Based-Stroke-Risk-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. This model aims to assist in early diagnosis and potential intervention, improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

The project involves analyzing the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis will leverage libraries such as numpy and pandas for data manipulation, and sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset into training and test sets. Logistic Regression will be used to build a predictive model to determine the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

### Data Description

1. age: The person's age in years

2. sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

3. cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

4. trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5. chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

6. fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

7. restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

8. thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

9. exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

12. ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

13. thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

14. target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
